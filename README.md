# Log

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcw/log.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcw/log)

A log package based on PHP's excellent Monolog library.

## WARNING

The API is not yet STABLE. Some things WILL change. Please wait for a 1.0
release if you're not kin to update your code from time to time.

## Why?

I felt really limited by the implementation of `log` and `log/syslog` packages.
Coming from the PHP world, I used to work with
[monolog](https://github.com/seldaek/monolog) which is really good and based
upon the python logbook package itself. I decided to port it to go and enjoy.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [godoc.org](http://godoc.org/github.com/marcw/log)

## Acknowledgements

This package is heavily inspired by Jordi Boggiano's 
[monolog](https://github.com/seldaek/monolog) library.

## License

The Log code is free to use and distribute, under the [MIT
license](https://github.com/marcw/log/blob/master/LICENSE).
